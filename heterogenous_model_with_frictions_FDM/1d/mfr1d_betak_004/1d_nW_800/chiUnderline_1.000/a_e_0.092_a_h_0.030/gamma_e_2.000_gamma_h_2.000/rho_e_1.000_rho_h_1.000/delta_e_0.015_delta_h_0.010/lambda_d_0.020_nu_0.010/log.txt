Computing for error
Updating value functions

========================= Iteration: 0 =============================
First iteration: no error information.
Households allowed to hold capital, use kappa = w or the preloaded solution as guess.
Households are allowed to hold capital - need to solve for kappa. Inner tolerance: 1e-05
Experts are either not allowed to isuse equity or the constraint binds always, setting chi to constraint everywhere
Inner loop is completed; time elapsed: 0.137718; took 1976 iterations.
Finished computing derivs
Finished updating equilibrium quantities. Next step: update matrices.
Finished updating matrix.
Finished updating the known vector.
